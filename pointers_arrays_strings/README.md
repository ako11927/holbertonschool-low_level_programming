# Pointers, Arrays and Strings

Holberton School low-level programming project.

## Learning Objectives
- Pointers: what they are and how to use them
- Arrays: declaration, indexing, iteration
- Differences between pointers and arrays
- Strings: null-terminated char arrays, traversal and manipulation
- Scope of variables

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04, `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Betty style
- No globals; â‰¤ 5 functions per file
- No standard library (except `printf` in task 8); use `_putchar` where needed
