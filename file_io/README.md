# File I/O Project

This project covers low-level file operations in C using system calls.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- How to create, open, close, read, and write files using system calls.
- What file descriptors are and how they work.
- The three standard file descriptors (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`) and their POSIX names.
- The difference between a system call and a library function.
- How to handle file permissions and flags like `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, and `O_RDWR`.

## Allowed Functions and System Calls
- `open`
- `close`
- `read`
- `write`
- `malloc`
- `free`
- `exit`
- `dprintf` (for task 3 only)

## Compilation
All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using:
